# Development Notes

Cleaning the README for potential SEO indexing.

I had a lot of fun with this pokedex and it was an amazing refresher of latest web technologies right after 1 year of working with jQuery.

I must sadly note that the load more button, in this version, is not working correctly (it adds data, but doesn't refresh UI properly).

I feel it has more to do with the current react architecture than the updateQuery code for the relay implementation of the pagination of the apollo client library.

I added optional imagery linking to an external https API. It won't load automatically, it has to be enabled.

Thanks a lot for submitting the challenge to me.
