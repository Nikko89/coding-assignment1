# Development Notes

Cleaning the README for potential SEO indexing.

I had a lot of fun with this pokedex and it was an amazing refresher of latest web technologies right after 1 year of working with jQuery.

## Tasks:

Implement front-end with React, TS and apollo client from scratch.

Implement pokemons_by_type query on the back-end.

## Features:

Search first 150 pokemons by name or type, adjust load and display quantities. 

I added optional imagery linking to an external https API. It won't load automatically, it has to be enabled.

Thanks a lot for submitting the challenge to me.

# How to start

`npm install`

both client and server folder. From the server folder:

`npm start`

then from another terminal tab, cd into client and start it too:

`npm start`

You should be able to see the project on port 3000 of localhost.
